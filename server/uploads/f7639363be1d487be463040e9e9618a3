Shikha, The main issue here is if the user has not given permission to access these values, using those token will give error not defined for those property.
The way to avoid those error is to check if the response has these property. First check if the response has returned these property before assigning to a variable.
Try to check with including something like:-
if(response.hasOwnProperty('picutre')){ 
   $.url = response.picture.data.url; 
} 
if(response.hasOwnProperty('name')){ 
   $.nn = response.name; 
} 
if(response.hasOwnProperty('cover')){ 
   $.cov  = response.cover.source; 
} 
if(response.hasOwnProperty('age_range')){ 
   $.age1 = response.age_range.min; 
} 
if(response.hasOwnProperty('hometown')){ 
   $.hom = response.hometown.name; 
} 
 
 instead of simply assigning these values to a variable.
$.url = response.picture.data.url;
 |   				$.nn = response.name;
 |   				$.cov  = response.cover.source;
 |   				$.age1 = response.age_range.min;
 |   				$.hom = response.hometown.name;
